Non-Functional Requirements (30 total):
This portion of the marks will be allocated by the TA based on the quality of your demonstration recording. Within the recording you should aim to answer all of the questions outlined in the assignment. You should ensure that you demonstrate your understanding of the algorithms and data used in the assignment even if software modules were used to perform the computations. You should also discuss the overall quality of your implementation, including critiques of it's efficiency, scalability, etc., and elaborate on how it could be improved.

Based on your recording, the TA will assign a grade for this portion using the rough breakdown below:
Demonstrates excellent understanding of all components of the assignment (25-30)
Demonstrates good understanding of all components of the assignment (20-25)
Demonstrates a good understanding of most components but some areas are lacking (15-20)
Demonstrates understanding of some components of the assignment but needs significant improvement (10-15)
Demonstrates a poor understanding of the assignment as a whole (0-10)
